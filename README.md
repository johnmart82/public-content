# John's shared content
Repository for content that I have created and shared via my blog, public presentations, etc.

# License info
There is no one license which covers all content in this repository, in each folder there will be an applicable license file and README.md file which has the appropriate information. This allows me to use appropriate licences for media content and code content so that it is clear what they can be used for.
